// how to automatically declare a variable 
// x; /* as it is not declared explicitly by var or let or const keyword, it will give an error(x is not defined)*/
// y; /* as it is not declared explicitly by var or let or const keyword, it will give an error(y is not defined)*/
// z; /* as it is not declared explicitly by var or let or const keyword, it will give an error(z is not defined)*/
x = 5; /*here x is not declared explicitly, assigned value and used. As it is used, it is declared by javascript automatically*/
y = 6; /*here y is not declared explicitly, assigned value and used. As it is used, it is declared by javascript automatically*/
z = x + y; /*here z is not declared explicitly, assigned value and used. As it is used, it is declared by javascript automatically*/
console.log(x, y, z)
